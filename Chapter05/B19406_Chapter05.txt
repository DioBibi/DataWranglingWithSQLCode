Identifying Null/Missing Values
SELECT COUNT(*) AS null_count FROM customers WHERE email IS NULL; 
NULL Values vs 0
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE phone IS NULL;

SELECT name, COALESCE(phone, 'N/A') AS phone FROM customers;
IS NULL() and IS NOT NULL() - Case Scenario 
SELECT 
       make, 
       model, 
       last_service, 
       next_service 
FROM vehicles
WHERE next_service IS NULL;

SELECT 
       make, 
       model, 
       last_service, 
       next_service 
FROM vehicles
WHERE next_service IS NOT NULL;
IFNULL()
SELECT IFNULL(name, 'N/A') FROM table_name;
OR
SELECT IFNULL(name, 0) FROM table_name;
Case Scenario

SELECT 
       IFNULL(customer_id, 'anonymous') as customer, 
       SUM(total) as total_sales
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer;

SELECT 
       IFNULL(age, 'unknown') as age, 
       SUM(spending) as total_spending
FROM customer
GROUP BY age;
COALESCE()
COALESCE(expression1, expression2, ... expression_n);

SELECT name, COALESCE(price, 0) AS price FROM orders;
Result:
This will result in 0 for missing values as we are using 0 where the price is null.
Case Scenario
SELECT name, COALESCE(email, phone) AS contact_method FROM customers;

SELECT 
       post, 
       COALESCE(likes, 0) AS likes, 
       COALESCE(shares, 0) AS shares 
FROM posts;

* Using "IS NULL"
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary IS NULL; 
* Using "= NULL"

* Using "IS NULL"

SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary IS NULL; 
* Using "= NULL"
