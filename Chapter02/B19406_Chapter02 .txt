Practical Exercise
Step 1 – Discovery
Example: 
Select count(phone) from customers;
SQL Code: 
Select distinct count(phone) from customers

We then use the following query to see what the distinct values in the data are:

Select 
x, 
count(distinct x) 
from table 
Group by x
For Example, using this query in the above population:

Select
 phone, 
count(distinct phone) as count1 
from customers
Group by phone
Step 2 - Structuring 
Example
Describe Customers;
Step 3 - Cleaning 
Handling Null Values
Update Customers
Set phone=NULL
Once this step is done, we use is null to deal with the missing values. 
Select count(*)
From customers  
Where phone is null
Handling Duplicate Values
We delete the duplicate value using the following query:
With cte as (
	Select
		 CustID,
	     	 Name,
	       Addrs,
            Phone,
            Gender,
          	 Email,
           Row_number() over (Partition by CustID,Name Order by                      CustID,Name ) row_num1
     From
         Customers
)

Delete 
from cte
Where row_num >1;
